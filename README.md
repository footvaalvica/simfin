# simfin

A simple money managing application, if you think other apps have too many features, this one's for you.

Simfin works like this, `add` to add money, `remove` to remove it, `howmuch` to check how much you have and `history` to check the latest change you made. You can also just write `help` in the application to see all this.

You need python 3, to install it go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ or if you are in Linux, use your distro's package manager.

To execute it in Fedora 23, extract the simfin-master.zip to somewhere on your computer, navigate to simfin-master and then inside that directory run ```python3 simfin.py```
